# pickup

A new Flutter project.

# Fixes:

- [x] Reset myUser to null when logged out. <- Just did it. Test it out.

- [ ] Disallow currently joined users from joining the same game/chat.

- [ ] Occational GameService error when logged out. Figure out why??? <-- Might just be because I changed some things and reloaded, causing the internal state of the app to be different than expected.
